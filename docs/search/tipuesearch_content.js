It should be a self-closing tag. Neither the header nor the entire document use an \"HTML\" closing tag The header MAY have one or more attribute\/values; the values MAY be wrapped in double or single quotes.  If an attribute value contains a space, it MUST be wrapper in single or double quotes. The YAML frontmatter MAY begin with 3 or more - characters, or this line MAY be omitted. The metadata section MAY be present, which is YAML and can be as many lines as you'd like. The YAML frontmatter MUST end with 3 or more - characters. The markdown section MUST contain an top-level title, e.g. # Some Object Title The markdown section MAY contain indefinite additional markdown text.   Relaxed Mode  Relaxed mode allows for less typing.   Header closing is optional. Header properties MUST only be wrapped in quotes when the value contains a space, otherwise quotes MAY be omitted. YAML frontmatter does not need to be preceeded by a --- line.   Here's the above example in relaxed mode:              &lt;bug projectId=0d6c69da-3167-11e9-901e-69eb3dc3eca4&gt;             url: 'http:\/\/seao.local.loft\/'             screen:                 width: 1152                 height: 2048                 colorDepth: 24                 pixelDepth: 24                 orientation: 270             device: mac             ---             # asdfsadf              safsafsa   application\/prs.taskcamp.cmd+text ","tags":"","url":"mime-types.html"},{"title":"Search Results","text":" ","tags":"","url":"search--results.html"}]};
